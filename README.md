# Date::WorkdayCalendar

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/perl6-community-modules/Date-WorkdayCalendar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/perl6-community-modules/Date-WorkdayCalendar)

The `WorkdayCalendar` and `Workdate` objects allow date calculations to be
made on a calendar that considers workdays (also called "business days").

Built on top of the `Date` datatype, it uses a calendar file to specify how
many days a workweek has and which days are to be considered holidays.

By default, the workweek is composed of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday.  Saturday and Sunday form the weekend.

Although most countries have a Monday to Friday workweek, some have very
different ones.

More information about workweeks can be found at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workweek>.

## Usage

    use v6;
    use Date::WorkdayCalendar;

    # construct a default workday calendar
    my $calendar = WorkdayCalendar.new;

    # work out the next workday away from the given date
    # 2016-11-18 is a Friday
    $calendar.workdays-away(Date.new('2016-11-18'), 1);  # 2016-11-21

    # construct a workday calendar from a file
    my $calendar-from-file = WorkdayCalendar.new('days.cal');

    # create a workdate from a date string
    my $workdate = Workdate.new('2016-05-02');

    # create a workdate from a Date object
    my $date = Date.new('2016-11-18');
    my $workdate-from-date = Workdate.new($date);

    # is the day a workday?
    $workdate = Workdate.new('2016-11-18');
    $workdate.is-workday;  # True
    $workdate.is-weekend;  # False
    $workdate.is-holiday;  # False
